# simple_encrypt_decrypt
A program I designed using C++.  It takes a text file converts to characters to ascii codes, but not its direct ascii.

This only works to simple files ending with .txt extension.  This program was not tested for other files.  

OUT OF THE BOX
1.  Included is the cpp file
2.  Encrypt_decrypt executable
3.  A test file


INSTRUCTIONS
Make sure you have a simple text file with a .txt extension to begin with and put whatever wording you would like.  You could use the test file I provided which is a quote from George Washington.

The screen will prompt you to type in either "E" or "D", which is encryption or decryption respectively.  It then will ask you for the file name (test.txt, if using my example).  Next you will be prompted to make a new file with the new encrypted contents.  (I usually name the file testE.txt).  Go ahead and view the contents of the file and depending on compilation it will spit our different characters.  To deencrypt just follow the same instructions.

One small bug I noticed, is, there will be a little bit of junk characters placed at the end.  If someone knows why this is happening, let me know, or fork this and help me correct the issue.
